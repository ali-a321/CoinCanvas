# CoinCanvas
Built using React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. This crypto portfolio tracking platform allows logged-in users to search, add, and remove cryptocurrencies from their portfolios. Once added, users can document each coin's transaction history, purchase price, quantity, total cost, and date of acquisition. The interface enables users to edit and delete transactions. The user dashboard showcases total portfolio value, gain/loss, USD holdings, coin quantities, and percentage changes over the past day. It also includes an interactive line graph illustrating portfolio performance across yearly, monthly, and weekly intervals, along with a pie chart representing holding distribution. To enhance usability, users can sort their coin holdings based on USD value in ascending or descending order. The MySQL database is hosted on AWS through RDS, while the Node.js Express server operates on AWS EC2.\
