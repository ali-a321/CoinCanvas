# CoinCanvas
Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. This crypto portfolio tracking site enables logged in users to search, add & delete cryptocurrencies into their portfolio. Once added, they have the ability to add their transaction history for each coin which includes the purchase price, quantity bought, total cost, and date of purchase.  Users can edit & delete transactions. The user dashboard displays their total portfolio value, total portfolio gain/loss, coin holdings in USD & coins held, the percentage change of each crypto over the last day, a line graph of their portfolio performance over the last year, month, and week, a pie graph showing their holding distribution. Users can also filter coins based on value in USD in decreasing/ascending order. The MySQL database is hosted on AWS through RDS and the backend Node.js Express server on AWS through EC2.
